        <h1>Installing Arch Linux with GNOME</h1>
        <p>This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing Arch Linux using the `archinstall` script and setting up GNOME as the desktop environment.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Boot from the Arch Linux Installation Media</h2>
        <p>Begin by booting your computer from the Arch Linux installation media (Presuming you already have a bootable drive with Arch installed on it). Once booted, you'll be presented with the Arch Linux boot menu.</p>
        <p>Hit enter to start</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Connect to the Internet</h2>
        <p>Ensure your computer is connected to the internet. You can connect to a Wi-Fi network using the `iwctl` command:</p>
        <code>
            iwctl<br>
            station device scan<br>
            station device get-networks<br>
            station device connect SSID
        </code>

        <h2>Step 3: Run Archinstall</h2>
        <p>Once you're connected to the internet, run the `archinstall` script to begin the installation process:</p>
        <code>
            archinstall
        </code>

        <p>Follow the prompts to configure your installation. When asked for a desktop environment, choose GNOME.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Reboot into Your New System</h2>
        <p>After the installation is complete, reboot your computer. Remember to remove the installation media so that you boot into your new Arch Linux installation rather than the live environment.</p>
        <code>
            reboot
        </code>

        <h2>Step 5: Log in and Enjoy GNOME</h2>
        <p>Upon reboot, you should be greeted with the GDM login screen, courtesy of GNOME. Log in using the credentials you set during the installation.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Congratulations! You have successfully installed Arch Linux with the GNOME desktop environment using `archinstall`. Enjoy your sleek, new, and customizable Arch Linux setup.</p>
