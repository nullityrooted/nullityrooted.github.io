        <h1>Simple Arch Linux install</h1>
        <p>
            I promise this isn't as bad as doing it all manually!
        </p>
        <p>This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing Arch Linux using the `archinstall` script and setting up GNOME as the desktop environment.</p>

        <p>
            Feel free to select another option in the installer if you would like to test out another desktop environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            My suggestion first off would be to download the ISO file for Arch from <b><a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:9cbdc6927dc328ceb82fdd695d709a23db3ec80b&dn=archlinux-2024.03.01-x86_64.iso">HERE</a></b>
        </p>

        <p>
            If you would prefer a direct download check <b>
                <a href="https://archlinux.org/download/">HERE</a>
            </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            If you download the ISO directly, <b><i>MAKE SURE YOU VERIFY</i></b> the ISO first! Someone may be hosting a compromised version on their web server and you don't want that!
        </p>

        <p>
            Once that's done, flash the ISO onto a USB drive etc.
        </p>



        <h2>Step 1: Boot from the Arch Linux Installation Media</h2>
        <p>Begin by booting your computer from the Arch Linux installation media (Presuming you already have a bootable drive with Arch installed on it). Once booted, you'll be presented with the Arch Linux boot menu.</p>
        <img src="img/archstartup.png" alt="">
        <p>
            Select Arch Linux install medium and hit Enter.</p>

        <p>
            If you cant see and the font is too small, try entering this command to switch the font type and size for smaller screens:
        </p>

        <code>
            setfont ter-132n
        </code>

        <p>
            It should now look something like this:
        </p>
        <img src="img/archfont.png" alt="">

        <h2>Step 2: Connect to the Internet</h2>
        <p>Ensure your computer is connected to the internet. You can connect to a Wi-Fi network if you are on a laptop using the `iwctl` command, if you are hard wired, just enter the ping command as shown below:</p>
        <code>
            iwctl<br>
        </code>

        <p>
            The following code scans for wireless devices on your hardware (if your hardware is called wlan0):
        </p>

        <code>
            station wlan0 scan
        </code>

        <p>
            This command will list available networks within range (replace device with your device name, it might be wlan0 or something similar from the code we entered above):
        </p>

        <code>
            station wlan0 get-networks
        </code>

        <p>
            No connect to your network with the following command:
        </p>

        <code>
            station wlan0 connect "Your Network Name"
        </code>

        <p>
            It should then prompt you for your network password to log in, enter this and you should be connected.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now let's double check that it's connected properly, exit out of iwctl by entering:
        </p>

        <code>
            exit
        </code>

        <p>
            Then run a ping command to test if you are connected to the internet:
        </p>

        <code>
            ping google.com 
        </code>

        <p>
            You should see it returning responses with <b>0% packet loss</b>, if you see nothing returning, start again with step 1, it may not be connected correctly.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 3: Run Archinstall</h2>
        <p>Once you're connected to the internet, run the `archinstall` script to begin the installation process:</p>
        <code>
            archinstall
        </code>

        <p>
            You should now see something like this:
        </p>
        <img src="img/archinstall.png" alt="">

        <p>Follow the prompts to configure your installation. When asked for a desktop environment, choose GNOME.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Archinstall language:</b> 
            <p>
                Self explanatory.
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Mirrors:</b> 
            <p>
                Choose a mirror closest to your location, i.e., Europe/Berlin for instance if you live in Germany. This way you get the fastest mirrors nearest to you for updates etc.
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Locales:</b> 
            <p>
                For locales, select the locales you want for your region or layout.
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Disk Configuration:</b> 
             <p>
                You can select your main disk if you would like, and can proceed with btrfs, default structure and compression as is.
             </p>
            <p>
                I would also recommend setting up disk <b>encryption</b> with a decently strong password, this way nobody can access the drive should they get ahold of the device.
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Bootloader, Swap</b> and <b>Hostname:</b> 
            <p>
                These can be left alone unless you want to modify those or change the system name from the default of archlinux.
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Root Password:</b>
            <p>
                Make sure to set a <b>strong</b> user password, not 12345...
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>User Account:</b>
            <p>
                Set up an account and a password to be able to login to the Gnome desktop environment in this case.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want your user to be able to run commands as root, select yes for making your user a superuser.
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Profile:</b>
            <p>
                This is where you choose your profile type. Desktop, Server, Minimal, or Xorg. We will select Desktop for the purposes of this tutorial.
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Scroll down to Gnome and hit tab to select it and press Enter.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Graphics Driver, select the relevant option for your device on your laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can leave the Greeter as gdm.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Audio:</b>
            <p>
                Select pipewire here.
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Network configuration:</b> 
            <p>
                Select NetworkManager.
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Timezone:</b>
            <p>Select a relevant timezone for you, i.e., Europe/Berlin etc.</p>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Finally:</b> 
            <p>
                Navigate down to install at the bottom and hit enter.
            </p>
        </p>

        <p>
            It will ask you if you would like to chroot into the newly installed system, hit no.
        </p>

        <p>
            You should see the following screen without any error.
        </p>

        <img src="img/complete.png" alt="">


        <p>
            Once the installer finishes without any errors, you are done! You should be able to restart the system into your new Arch Linux installation.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 4: Reboot into Your New System</h2>
        <p>After the installation is complete, reboot your computer. Remember to remove the installation media so that you boot into your new Arch Linux installation rather than the live environment.</p>
        <code>
            reboot
        </code>

        <h2>Step 5: Log in and Enjoy GNOME</h2>
        <p>Upon reboot, you should be greeted with the GDM login screen, courtesy of GNOME. Log in using the credentials you set during the installation.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Congratulations! You have successfully installed Arch Linux with the GNOME desktop environment using `archinstall`. I hope this process was easy enough to follow and I hope you enjoyed it! Stay tuned for more tutorials.</p>
